# Image Caption Generator using Python GUI

Hi! This project focuses on creating Captions for image inputs. This was built as a Graphical User Interface for the greatest user experience and provides an interface similar to that of an external app.

- **JPEG**
- **JPG**
- **PNG** 

> The compact image size will be 614 x 408. Resize your image before using as an input.
